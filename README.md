# Install

Using the most recent release package, do the following.
- Install [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/download/), or [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com) and follow setup in either respective launcher. 
- If on Windows skip this step, if not please read. Re-compress if on MacOS, it automatically decompresses .zip files that are downloaded, if you do not you will not be able to locate the file to import. 
- For Prism, click on the top left corner button that says "Add Instance", then select "Import from Zip". Select the previously downloaded release zip and let install.
- For CurseForge click "Create Custom Profile" near the top right corner. Then click "import" and select the previously downloaded release zip.
